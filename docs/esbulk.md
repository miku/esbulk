=============================================================

NAME
----

esbulk - send documents to elasticsearch in bulk and in parallel.

SYNOPSIS
--------

`esbulk` [`-server` *URL*, `-index` *name*, `-size` *N*, `-w` *N*, `-z`] < *file*

DESCRIPTION
-----------

esbulk takes as input a newline delimited JSON file and indexes all documents
into elasticsearch running on a given server address. The documents are batched and
indexed in parallel to achieve a high indexing throughput.

The newline delimited JSON text file format is explained at http://jsonlines.org/.

OPTIONS
-------

`-0`
  Set the number of replicas to 0 during indexing (this can speed up indexing significantly, the original value is restored at the end and may cause delay until the cluster is green).

`-cpuprofile` *filename*
  Write cpu profile to given filename.

`-id` *string*
  Reuse value from this field as id. By Default ids are autogenerated.

`-index` *string*
  Index name.

`-mapping` *filename*
  Mapping string or filename to apply before indexing.

`-memprofile` *filename*
  Write memory profile to given filename.

`-purge`
  Purge any existing index before reindexing. Warning: No confirmation required.

`-server` *URL*
  SOLR hostport including like http://localhost:9200/

`-size` *N*
  Batch size. Defaults to 1000. Increase for small documents.

`-type` *string*
  Elasticsearch type (deprecated in 6.0.0, https://is.gd/HFsOWt). Default is "default".

`-u` *string*
  HTTP basic authentication "username:password" (like curl -u).

`-v`
  Program version.

`-verbose`
  Show progress.

`-w` *N*
  Number of workers.

`-z`
  Decompress gzip input file on the fly.

EXAMPLES
--------

Index a compressed file:

  `esbulk -index abc -verbose -server 110.81.131.200:9200 -z file.ldj.gz`

Index from standard input:

  `cat file.ldj | esbulk -index abc -server 110.81.131.200:9200`

Purge an existing index, apply a mapping from a file and index:

  `esbulk -purge -mapping mapping.json -index abc file.ldj`

DIAGNOSITCS
-----------

If indexing pressure on the bulk API is too high (dozens or hundreds of
parallel workers, large batch sizes, depending on you setup), esbulk will halt
and report an error:

```
$ esbulk -index my-index-name -w 100 file.ldj
2017/01/02 16:25:25 error during bulk operation, try less workers (lower -w value) or
increase thread_pool.bulk.queue_size in your nodes
```

Please note that, in such a case, some documents are indexed and some are not.
Your index will be in an inconsistent state, since there is no transactional
bracket around the indexing process.

However, using defaults (parallism: number of cores) on a single node setup
will just work. For larger clusters, increase the number of workers until you
see full CPU utilization. After that, more workers won't buy any more speed.
